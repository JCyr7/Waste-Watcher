AWS-kayak-db1.session.sql is the sql file I used as a workspace to see the live changes I made in the database.
This includes:
  -Table Creation
  -Table Removal
  -Modifications
  -Appendices
  -Descriptions
  -Comparisons
  -Insertions
  -Deletions
  -Selections

The --@block allows individual queries to be run in the same file
